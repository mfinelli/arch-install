# dropbox

Installs the Dropbox "open-source helper application" found on the main
Dropbox linux page: https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux.

Unfortunately, they don't make the repository signing key readily available
so I downloaded the latest `.deb` and extracted it from the `postinst` script.

If the Dropbox desktop application is desired it can be downloaded from their
main download page as it appears to be behind a login wall now:
https://www.dropbox.com/install

TODO: follow the approach that the AUR package takes:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dropbox
